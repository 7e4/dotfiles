# My Dotfiles

This is a repository with my configuration files.

To use this configurations you have to clone this repository and run the stow_all script.
This will always be a WIP repo.

## Contents

[curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) configs

### `/glava`

### `/ncmpcpp`

[ncmpcpp](https://github.com/arybczak/ncmpcpp) configs

### `/scripts`

All my custom scripts, most of them are used for music related stuff.
I heavily rely on programs like:

+ fd <https://github.com/sharkdp/fd>
+ rg <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>
+ xsv <https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv>
+ fzf <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>
+ dunst <https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst>

If you don't know them, check their repos. They are, in my opinion,a most for anyone that spends a lot of time on the cli.
