# My Dotfiles

This is a repository with my configuration files.

To use this configurations you have to clone this repository and run the stow_all script.
This will always be a WIP repo.

My focus for now is music, most scripts are related to that.
The music directory is organized as /_"artist"_ - _"genre"_/_"release year"_ - _"album"_ - Cd _"disc number"_/_"tracknumber"_. _"song title"_
This helps a lot with all the scripting and configs.
